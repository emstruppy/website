<h2>Revit: Villa Savoye</h2>
  <div style="display: flex;">
    <img width="400px" height="300px" src="villa.jpg">
    <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:25px;">
      I had the opportunity to take a CAD class specializing in Revit. I learned how to implement architectual
    elements to create a simple space. The final project was to recreate the Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye. I learned 
    how to find furniture and use different materials. I also learned to create section cuts.

<h2 >Children's Museum Exhibit</h2>
<div style="display: flex;">
  <img width="600px" height="400px" src="cars.jpg">
  <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:25px;">
    I participated in a junior level design class to design a STEM exhibit for a local
    children's museum. My groups project explored the concept of elastic and inelastic 
    collisions by the use of cars on a track. I acted as lead design and 3D modeled the tracks and magnet holder pieces
    on the fronts of the cars in SolidWorks. I also got trained in the woodshop to be able to cut and sand the 
    wooden parts. The cars could be turned so that if pushed together they would attract
    and if the magnets were opposing they would repel.

  <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:25px;">
    In my beginer level design course I worked with a team to create a concept for a commercial electric
    vehicle charging station. I was also lead design and did our drawings and led construction of our model.

  <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:25px;">
  I took a computational tools class where I learned the basics of finite elment analysis and computational 
  fluid dynamics through SolidWorks through a series of weekly assignments. I would model 
  the part and then run a specific study on the model and compare the results with the hand-solved 
  solution.

<h2>Subsea 7 Pipeline Design Internship</h2>
<div style="display: flex;">
  <img width="600px" height="400px" src="ss7.jpeg">
  <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:25px;">
    This past summer I interned at Subsea 7 in Houston,TX as a Pipeline Design Intern. My task was 
    to compare mitigation methods for lateral buckling of high pressure high temperature subsea oil and
    gas pipelines. To do my comparison I used a company developed tool to create a finite element model
    of the specific pipeline under different cases using sleepers as mitigation. I compared compressive
    longitudinal strain and amplitude with the actual pipeline that utilizes rotating buoyancy
    modules. I also wrote a technical note and presented to all the department managers.
