<p  style="font-size:25px; text-align:center; line-height:30px;"> I am from Cypress, Texas which is a little bit outside of Houston. My two favorite things in the world outside my family and friends of course, is softball and Disney! I grew up going to Disney and even now I feel inspired to dream through the magic they create. I have played softball since I was 5, so it is a really big part of the person I am today. It taught me alot of tough lessons as well as gave me some of my greatest friends. I chose Penn State because it allowed me to go to a fantastic engineering school as well as start my first two years at a branch campus so I could continue to play softball. Durring my time at Penn State Berks I became a Lion Ambassador, a leader in student-athlete organizations and a member of SWE. </p>
